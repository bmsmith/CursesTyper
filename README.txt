Hackertyper is a linux implementation of the http://www.hackertyper.com/ program. It's a cute little fun project I undertook in my spare time to demonstrate the curses API. I'll probably check back on it from time to time, but for now, enjoy.

To set up, you do need to compile hackertyper.c with the curses API, so watch out for that. 
I'm assuming you're compiling with "hackertyper" as the output file, but it doesn't really matter. You can make it what you want, just be aware that the in-program instructions may either not make sense or will have to be edited.
